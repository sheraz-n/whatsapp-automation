To Do:

1- Create account on Twilio for whatsapp bot. Activate it by sending a message to provided twilio whatsapp number from your whatsapp account (We will call this number twilio number now onwards).
2- Create account and make cluster on mongodb
3- Download and install node package manager (download node.js installer and install it)
4- Verify npm using  following: 
		npm -v
5- Using npm install packages:
	npm install -g nodemon  localtunnel
6- Ready a python environment having flask and python 3.10 (3.10 is not necessary) as follows:
	conda install flask pymongo dnspython
	pip install twilio
7- prepare main.py with following code:
//////Begin Code//////
	from flask import Flask, request
	from twilio.twiml.messaging_response import MessagingResponse
	app = Flask(__name__)
	@app.route("/", methods = ["get","post"])
	def reply():
	    response = MessagingResponse()
	    response.message("Hello")
	    return str(response)

	if __name__ == "__main__":
	    app.run(port=5000)
/////End Code ////////
8- Execute command:
	nodemon main.py
9- In second Terminal Execute following: (lt stands for localtunnel, sheraznaseer is name and must be very unique)
	nodemon --watch "main.py" --exec "lt --subdomain sheraznaseer --port 5000" --delay 3
10- Step 9 will give you a web address URL like:
	http://sheraznaseer.loca.lt
11- Go to twilio.com, open console, go to Messaging->Settings->whatsapp sandbox Settings and Put the above URL in Sandbox Configuration then save.
12- Test the app by sending a whatsapp message to twilio number (Verify that it is activate). You should get a response. 
13 - Kill processes by Ctrl+C and npx kill-port 5000
//////////The first part of the application is complete////////
1- The next part is to add the mongoDB. This is achieved by using pymongo package
	from pymongo import MongoClient
2- Create a Ddatabase and collections in mongoDB by going on to the mongoDB site in our cluster.
3- Create a connection to DB and get the connection URL.
cluster = MongoClient("mongodb+srv://imsheraz:19821982@cluster0.ujwntnr.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority")
# The URL can be achieved by creating a connection to the cluster initilaizeed in Step 2.

//// Deploy on Heroku/////
Create a Procfile contianing following command.
web: gunicorn app:app --log-file=-
